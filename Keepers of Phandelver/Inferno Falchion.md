**Rarity:** Rare

## Description:

This blazing falchion is made of a shimmering red metal that seems to be on fire. The hilt is wrapped in enchanted leather that crackles with intense heat, and the blade glows with a fierce flame.

## Abilities:

-   Once per short or long rest, the wielder can activate the Inferno Falchion's power and cause it to burst into a blazing inferno. For the next minute, the falchion deals an extra 2d6 fire damage on a hit.
-   However, the intense heat generated by the Inferno Falchion causes the weapon to become unstable. Whenever the wielder misses with an attack using the weapon, there is a chance it could overload and deal damage to the wielder. The wielder must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + the wielder's proficiency bonus + their Strength or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher) or take 2d6 fire damage.
