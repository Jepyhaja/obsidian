The party is hired by the mayor of a nearby town to investigate reports of strange occurrences in the Kryptfgraden forest. They quickly discover that a powerful basilisk has taken up residence in a nearby cave and is turning people to stone. The mayor promises a hefty reward if they are able to defeat the creature and save the town. The party travels to the forest and soon finds the cave. Inside, they find a large chamber filled with petrified victims of the basilisk. At the end of the chamber is the basilisk itself, a fearsome beast with venomous fangs and a gaze that can turn anything to stone. The party must battle their way through the chamber and defeat the basilisk. They must also be careful to avoid the basilisk's gaze, as even a single glance can turn them to stone. The party can use the environment to their advantage, setting up traps and creating distractions to keep the basilisk off balance. With careful tactics and a bit of luck, the party can defeat the basilisk and save the town.
The players must now decide how to handle the situation. If they decide to fight it, they will have to be careful not to look directly into the basilisk's eyes or they will be instantly petrified. If they choose to try to communicate with the beast, they must be cautious not to anger it. No matter what they decide, the players must be careful and work together if they hope to succeed. If they are able to defeat the basilisk, they will be rewarded with valuable treasures that the creature had hoarded up in its cave.
Once the basilisk has been defeated, the mayor rewards the party with the promised reward and they return to town triumphant.
