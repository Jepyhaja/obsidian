*Unique* | Book of Eldritch Knowledge
This book contains rituals for infusing powers of **the great old ones** into ones body by using organs and bodyparts of monstrosities as the binding agent.
Abilities gained from monsterparts vary depending on who you bind as your **patron**, though the book says you "borrow" the powers of **the great old ones** the effects seem irreversible to you.
The book has a story of warning that mentions a wizard named as [[Starks]] who in the end lost his body and soon after his mind to numerous binding rituals. The **patrons** powers became too addicting to this arcane exlporer, and he tried to contest the powers of gods.
