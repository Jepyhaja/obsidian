Potion, very rare

---
When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the **haste** spell for 1 minute (no concentration required). The potion’s yellow fluid is streaked with black and swirls on its own.

# Haste

Until the spell ends, the target’s **speed is doubled**, it gains a **+2 bonus to AC**, it has **advantage on Dexterity saving throws**, and it gains an **additional action** on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.

When the spell ends, the target can’t move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.
