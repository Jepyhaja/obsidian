---
**Stone Melding**: 
 >The basilisk can meld into stone at will, becoming indistinguishable from an inanimate statue. It can remain in this state for as long as it wishes, and it can move or take actions as normal while melding into stone.
  
  ---
**Bite**: 
>**+5** to hit, reach 5 ft. **14 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage**, if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a **DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute**. The poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
---

**Stone Gaze.** 
>If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failed save, the creature starts to turn into stone. Failing twice turns the whole creature into stone.

**Breath Weapon** (Recharge 5-6). 
>The basilisk exhales a blast of stone and rubble in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a **DC 14 Dexterity saving throw**, taking **28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save**, or half as much damage on a successful one.

# Legendary Actions

The basilisk can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The basilisk regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Meld into Stone** (3 actions). 
> The basilisk melds into stone. Until the end of its next turn, the basilisk is indistinguishable from an inanimate statue, and it has advantage on all Dexterity saving throws and on all Dexterity checks to avoid being hit by an attack. While melded into stone, the basilisk can move through stone walls and other solid objects as if they were difficult terrain. It cannot end its turn inside an object, and it must exit the object on its next turn.

**Pounce**. 
>The basilisk moves up to its speed and makes a **bite attack** against a creature within reach. If the attack hits, the target must make a **DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone**.

**Stone Storm** (2 actions). 
>The basilisk lashes out with its powerful tail, sending a storm of stone and rubble flying in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
