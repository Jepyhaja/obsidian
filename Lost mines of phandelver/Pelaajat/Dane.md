Trained as a soldier on the [[island of Mintarn]], you traveled to
[[Neverwinter]] as part of a mercenary company that serves as both
army and city watch. You grew disillusioned with your fellow soldiers,
who seem to enjoy their authority at the expense of the people they’re
supposed to protect. Everything came to a head recently, when you
disobeyed an order and followed your conscience. You were suspended
from active duty, though you kept your rank and your connection to the
mercenaries. Since then, you have devoted yourself to your deity.

**Personal Goal**: **Teach the [[Redbrand]]s a Lesson**. You’ve heard that
[[Daran Edermath]] in the town of Phandalin is looking for people of
courage and principle to teach some bullies a lesson. These thugs, the
[[Redbrands]], have been throwing their weight around in Phandalin,
much as your compatriots did in [[Neverwinter]]. Putting a stop to their
villainy is a worthy goal.
