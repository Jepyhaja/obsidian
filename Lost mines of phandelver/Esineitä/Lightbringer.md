> This hammer was made by one of the greatest dwarwen weapon smiths Gernera Moltenshield and enchanted by a great human enchanter Mormesk Brightbind. The centuries of neglect do not reflect on the warhammer as it is in perfect condition. Its spike sharp as a needle and the flat as square as it was the day it was forged. The head of the hammer is made of layered metal, platinum and adamantine, a true display of craftmanship. The enchantment of the weapon seem to slumber still, surely after giving it some use the magic will flow again...
