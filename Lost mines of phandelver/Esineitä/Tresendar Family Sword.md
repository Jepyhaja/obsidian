> A longswod with a beautiful silver embroidered scabbard that belonged to the hero of old Phandalin the Vincent Tresendar. He fell while valiantly defending the old Phandalin as the Orc raids of Wave Echo Cave came. The blade is mirror polished steel with very faint citrine runic engravigs running down the blood line of the sword. Maybe more power can be channeled in to the runes. Even though the blade is half a millenia old it still is in pristine condition.

> Attunement to this sword is instantaneous for good aligned characters. When you attune to this sword you feel an instinct of protection towards the city of phandalin. Though it is not something that compels you to take action.
