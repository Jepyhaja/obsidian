Difficult terrain like bodies of water, dense forests, deep swamps, icy lands and steep mountains halve the speed.

Characters may travel a number of hours equal to their Constitution Score. After that, they must make a Constitution Save (vs. 10+1 per hour beyond their limit) or take 1 level of Exhaustion.

Asking the marching leader for a `DC 15 Wisdom (Survival)` check for navigation is advised for wilderness travel, each failure results in a 45Â° misdirection that the players are unaware of. After two successes they realise they were lost and fix their course.

If you wish to increase the tension, re-ask marching order, check who lacks darkvision, ask for a perception skill check and have them hear nothing but crickets. Fear of the unknown and unseen is part of the wilderness. **Do not over-use.**
