Direktiivin rakentaminen

```js
//directive.js
const myDirective = {
  // called before bound element's attributes
  // or event listeners are applied
  created(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {
    // see below for details on arguments
  },
  // called right before the element is inserted into the DOM.
  beforeMount(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},
  // called when the bound element's parent component
  // and all its children are mounted.
  mounted(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},
  // called before the parent component is updated
  beforeUpdate(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},
  // called after the parent component and
  // all of its children have updated
  updated(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},
  // called before the parent component is unmounted
  beforeUnmount(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},
  // called when the parent component is unmounted
  unmounted(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {}
}
```

```js
app.directive('color', (el, binding) => {
  // this will be called for both `mounted` and `updated`
  el.style.color = binding.value
})
```

```js
const app = createApp({})

// make v-focus usable in all components
app.directive('focus', {
  /* ... */
})
```
