Hello, don't know if this is the right place to post this but here it goes...
I made a tool for creating homebrew spells that you can easily print out to use at your table! I would appreciate anyone willing to take a look and give some feedback. https://loihdin.app is where the magic happens. It's still in early stages so you may encounter some bugs.

With Loihdin you can create unlimited spells without registration, but if you do register, you get to build your own homebrew spell catalogue and gain the ability to edit and duplicate old spells. The catalogue allows you to browse through your spells easily and filter them through a variety of metrics.

This app is a two people passion project, we have been working on for a while along our dayjobs, and we truly hope you enjoy it.

Thank you in advance for any feedback!
